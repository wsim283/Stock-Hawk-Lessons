### Product Quality:

1. **Creative Vision for Android in all apps**
   * Enchant Me
        * revolves around the idea that your app should both **look and act effortlessly**, through a well-placed animations and a feeling that the app was designed specifically for the user.
   * Simplify My Life
       * involves making the app **easy to understand**. Whether it's for a new user just trying to figure out what exactly your app does, or a returning user, where you're trying to make the experience as frictionless as possible.
   * Make Me Amazing
     * leveraging the strengths of Android to build apps that contribute to **building a whole greater than the sum of its parts**. Integrating into one another, and extending beyond a single entry point app, you need to remember to launch to get any benefit


2. **Getting Feedback**                                                    
Developers should know most, if not all of the functionalities of the app that they helped build, but this can be a bad thing. Since you spent all your time in the project developing, you would have to anticipate things and expect the behaviour of your app to go a certain way, this can keep you blindsided to what the app would look like from your users perspectives. Users are basically customers, what they say about the app is important as they are the one who will interact with the app longer than us developers. How do we retrieve their perspective? Well we can conduct user reviews for the app. Google has adopted this strategy for Android. If you have a google phone, you have the choice to join Android Beta program where you will get the latest Android versions straight to your phone. You can participate by sending bug reports and sharing your thoughts about the experience it has given you. 

    There are two types of feedback tools/principles for your product feedback:
     * **Quantitative**: in a form of numbers such as google analytics. For e.g. how many people signed in, how many hours are spent per users and so on.
    * **Qualitative**: Such as UX Review, interviews or even Direct Communication. This tends to be better at answering WHY questions such as why do they hate this orientation or like it?.
 

 3. **UX Review for Sunshine**: Currently about Sunshine (from lesson 6 Developing Android Apps), the tablet lanscape view has a "sea of white space" and this isn't consistent with our other screen devices such as portrait phone orientation. The use of surfaces are used to tackle this problem. So now in the new design, a white single elecated card is introduced to show conditions such as current temperature. This is used consistently across screens and it makes easier to do motion. Gives that nice and easy transition between list to detail activity. This falls under **Enchant me** in Android design principles and could really make sunshine stand out. Showing error feedback such as "No network connection" help us in the **Simplify My Life** department as the user now know that the problem for no information is due to no internet connection.
